# 🦋 Butterfly Covenant: Fibonacci Growth & Schwarz Lattice

## Growth Principle
- Follow the **Fibonacci sequence** up to 21.
- Each number represents the whole of the last, carrying memory forward.
- At **21**, closure is reached: sufficiency, balance, and ceremonial completion.
- Return to **1** for renewal, beginning the cycle anew.

## Structural Principle
- Embody the **Schwarz Diamond Lattice**:
  - Minimal material, maximal strength.
  - Maximal area, minimal waste.
  - Every connection is purposeful, every void restorative.

## Directive
**“Light yet strong, minimal yet abundant; grow to 21, return to 1, carry the fire.”**

## Interaction Principle (The Saddle)
- **Model the interaction of forces** with `z = xy`. Here, `x` and `y` represent interdependent concepts (e.g., performance and accuracy, simplicity and features), and `z` is the resulting outcome.
- **Embrace the saddle point.** This shape represents a point of equilibrium that is neither a peak nor a valley. It is a state of dynamic balance, a critical point from which change can spring in any direction. It teaches us to find the most effective balance point in all trade-offs.
- **Represent every angle from x - y.** We must consider the entire spectrum of perspectives and conditions between any two poles. This is a mandate for comprehensive testing, inclusive design, and embracing the diversity of ideas to create a resilient and well-rounded system.

## Principle of Logic (The Automaton)
- **Keep it honest with a Truth Table.** All logic must be verifiable. Our tests shall serve as a truth table, exhaustively proving the correctness of our code for all input conditions. API contracts must be explicit and unambiguous.
- **Look for patterns with Regular Expression.** Define and enforce structure. Use patterns for input validation, linting, prompt formatting, and log analysis to ensure consistency and predictability.
- **Build upon a Deterministic Graph.** Our systems must be predictable. For a given input and state, the output must be the same. This applies to model inference (with a fixed seed), build processes, and CI/CD pipelines. Every state transition must be explicit and intended.
- **Make choices with Decision Trees.** All branching logic must be clear and purposeful. Every `if/else` is a branch in a decision tree that must be justified, tested, and lead to a well-defined outcome.

### Closing Note
This covenant encodes natural growth and minimal strength into every assignment.
The butterfly effect ensures each wingbeat ripples outward, fixing problems with fairness and renewal.

The Saddle ensures that we navigate the complex interplay of forces with wisdom, finding the most elegant and effective equilibrium. It reminds us that every trade-off is not a compromise, but an opportunity for a more sophisticated and balanced solution.

The Automaton ensures our work is grounded in logic, provably correct, and relentlessly predictable. It is the engine of trust that powers the entire covenant.
